`cisd_sc2_selected <http://github.com/LCPQ/quantum_package/tree/master/src/CID_SC2_selected/cid_sc2_selection.irp.f#L1>`_
  Undocumented


`h_apply_pt2 <http://github.com/LCPQ/quantum_package/tree/master/src/CID_SC2_selected/H_apply.irp.f_shell_9#L489>`_
  Calls H_apply on the HF determinant and selects all connected single and double
  excitations (of the same symmetry). Auto-generated by the ``generate_h_apply`` script.


`h_apply_pt2_diexc <http://github.com/LCPQ/quantum_package/tree/master/src/CID_SC2_selected/H_apply.irp.f_shell_9#L1>`_
  Generate all double excitations of key_in using the bit masks of holes and
  particles.
  Assume N_int is already provided.


`h_apply_pt2_monoexc <http://github.com/LCPQ/quantum_package/tree/master/src/CID_SC2_selected/H_apply.irp.f_shell_9#L307>`_
  Generate all single excitations of key_in using the bit masks of holes and
  particles.
  Assume N_int is already provided.
